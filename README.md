# Contrast-Adaptation-Simulated-for-Memristor
Contrast adaptation simulated for memristor applied to the manuscript entitled “An antagonistic photovoltaic memristor for bioinspired active contrast adaptation” (Research Article, No. adma.202409844R1) for publication in Advanced Materials.

# Demo
Folder 'dataset' contains 2,000 training samples and 500 validation samples from scotopic adaptation at 8s.

# Note
Datasets and devices' data can be defined according to requirements, and the corresponding neural network training model should also be changed.
